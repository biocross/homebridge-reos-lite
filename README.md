Homebridge Plugin to control the [Reos Lite Bluetooth Bulb](https://www.flipkart.com/reos-lite-1100lm-smart-bulb/p/itmehvmfhradshpp)

Currently only supports turning the bulb off and on, since I couldn't find the exact bluetooth characteristics to control brightness / color. 

> Contributions welcome if anyone knows exactly which characteristic to write to.
